# Loan Risk Analysis - MLZilla Competition

## Problem Statement
Our work proposes two main methodologies: one is a tableau report, which provides detailed data analysis on the difference between people who are Default(Charged Off) and **potentially** good loans (Current). Another is a Machine Learning model that predicts defaulters, which would aid the financial industry in preventing financial loss.

### Secured 2nd place in the competition organized by the PlayBot committee at NMIMS.
### Detailed steps of model creation are given in the ppt.

## Our Analysis
- The model predicted a few of the ‘Current’ labels as Defaulters.
- There can be two POVs:
1. 23 could be the potential number of defaulters who won’t be able to repay the loan. Thus a good note to prevent losses by not giving them the loan.
2. There could be a minor precision error in the model, but it won’t affect much since it predicted only 23 labels as defaulters, which is not even 0.1% of the dataset.
