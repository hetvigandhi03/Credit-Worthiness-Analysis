# Loan Risk Analysis - MLZilla Competition

## Problem Statement
Our work proposes two main methodologies: one is a tableau report, which provides in detail data analysis on the difference between people who are Default(Charged Off) and potentially good loans (Current). Another is a Machine Learning model that predicts defaulters, which would aid the financial industry in preventing financial loss.

### Secured 2nd place in the competition organized by the PlayBot committee at NMIMS.
